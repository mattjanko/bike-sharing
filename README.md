Project synopsis:
Depending on date, time, and whether, a certain bike sharing system in Washington, DC 
sees hundreds of riders per hour or none at all. For many practical reasons (e.g., 
ensuring sufficient bike availability, scheduling maintenance, etc.), we wish to be able 
to predict how many bikes rides will take place on a given date and at a given time.
Using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we build three models to perform
this task,
* a linear regression model,
* a random forest, and
* a model using XGBoost.

Repository contents:
1. bike-sharing.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook with code and markup for the project
2. hour.csv - the data file for the project
